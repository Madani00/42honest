# 42honest

42 Subjects with an honest task description and frequent reason why projects were failed.

If you have a reason why you failed add it to the projects list.
If the reason already exists increment the number next to it.
And move it in the rank to sort my highest number.

If you dont know how to create pull requests. Then post it as Issue. I will add it.
